It combines the simplicity of a pentatonic music sequencer with traditional chord progressions to offer professional functionality and uncomplicated usability. The complex world of composing opens with a clear click.\r\n\r\nThe program was first designed for the [Congressional App Challenge] (http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), but we are still currently improving the program in our spare free time. Anyone who wants to help contribute can fork this repository and pull request!\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nGahwon Lee and Henry Wang for programming the application.\r\n",
