ClearComposer opens up music composition to anyone via its accessible interface. It combines the simplicity of a pentatonic music sequencer with traditional chord progressions to offer professional functionality and uncomplicated usability. The complex world of composing opens with a clear click.

The program was first designed for the [Congressional App Challenge] (http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), but we are still currently improving the program in our spare free time. Anyone who wants to help contribute can fork this repository and pull request!
